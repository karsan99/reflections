-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when i'm working in different places, for example, and I can't have all my files in my personal computer or when i'm working with a team.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because in that way i can take the control of what i want to change and when i want to change it.

-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?


-What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

-How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

-When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
