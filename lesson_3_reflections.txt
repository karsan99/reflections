-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when i'm working in different places, for example, and I can't have all my files in my personal computer or when i'm working with a team.

-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because in that way i can take the control of what i want to change and when i want to change it.
